				<p>We are a group of girls who code.Yep! you heard that right"girls".There is no evidence to suggest that ICT intrinsically suits boys better than girls so the members of vodacom and basali Thech made it a point to help narrow the attainment gap between boys and girls and persistant concerns about the number of females gaining qualifications in ICT and entering tech related professions.Our group has four members and each member plays a very important role in our coding project.
					Our team leader is Lerato Tsehlo but all members of the team are equally important  include Limpho Mafereka,Thato Sello and Lisemelo khoanyane.All of which are important elements of our very commited group.</p>

				<p>Informations and communication technology is a system used to control,manage,process and create information though telecommunications technology and computers Otherwise known as ICT.So this camp like we mentioned before was a coding camp where we learnt lots of amazing stuf like creating websites,logically structuring our content and also making our web pages look presentable."<footer><i>All work and no play doesn't just make jill and jack dull right?it kills the potential of discovery,mastery,flexibility and it hinders innovation"</i></footer>so we also tried engaging into some fun games:)
					<p>

					We love <i>ICT</i> because its a really fun and exciting subject.It gives us a chance to think outside the box and be innovative.Even though programming can be complicated at times it is really worth it.
					</p>

					<p>The camp made us realise that without <i>ICT</i> we arent going anywhere,for there are lots of emerging technologies which are used in the 4th  Industrial Revolution such as Artificial Intelligence,Virtual reality,Biometrics and Robotics.Nowadays ICT is everything in life because with the knowledge of computers you can do a lot of things.There is a wide carer range since it specialises in a .This becomes an advantage to us because it involves critical thinking.</p>
					<P>All in all,STEM is realy important because<ol
					><li>it pervades and keeps expanding into every aspect of our lives</li>
					<li>creates critical thinkers</li>
					<li>helps bridge the ethnic gender gap found in maths and science fields</li>
					<ul><li>to increase the roles of women and minorities in STEM related fields</li></ul>
					<li>Enables the next generation of innovators</li></ol></P>
